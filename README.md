## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Real-Time Signaling**: Socket.IO
- **Audio Protocol**: WebRTC & Web Audio API
- **Security**: node-forge (Auto-generates self-signed SSL certificates for local testing to allow mobile microphone access)

## How to Run Locally 🚀

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files.

### Starting the Server

### Accessing the App
The server will start on two ports:
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:3000` (Use this for desktop testing)
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:3443` (Use this if testing on a mobile device on the same Wi-Fi network. *Note: You will need to click "Advanced" -> "Proceed" to bypass the self-signed certificate warning.*)

To test the matchmaking locally, simply open two browser tabs to `http://localhost:3000` and click "Start Talking" in both tabs!
